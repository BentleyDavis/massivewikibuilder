# UPGRADE-2-to-3.md

We are preparing to switch from MWB v2 to MWB v3.

The new MWB v3 is ready for testing; just use `mwb3.py` in your build process instead of `mwb.py`. Please report any issues to the [MWB Repo Issues](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder/issues).

Not yet, but at some point, we will deprecate MWB v2 and ultimately, remove the code.

At that time, we will:

- remove Markdown from requirements.txt
- remove mwb_wikilink_plus, mwb_del
